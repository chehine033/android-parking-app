# android-parking-app
this app is a school project in which we (me and a classmate) are tasked to create an android app that indicates the closest parking spots to your current location all while using free APIs and creating a user interface with a login feature (firebase)
due to not having the required funds to acquire the google maps API that shows all the locations of the nearby parkings we opted to use the free api that allows only a window to open towards google maps
